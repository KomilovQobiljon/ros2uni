## Create a package

## Creating subscriber publisher in python
I created two nodes to publish and subscribe to data over a topic. Before running them, I added their dependencies and entry points to the package configuration files.
You can find its working video in py_pubsub file

## Creating service and client in python
I created two nodes to request and respond to data over a service. I added their dependencies and executables to the package configuration files so that I could build and run them, allowing me to see a service/client system at work. You can find its video in py_srvcli file

## Using parameters in python class
I created a node with a custom parameter, that can be set either from a launch file or the command line. I added the dependencies, executables, and a launch file to the package configuration files so that you could build and run them, and see the parameter in action.
